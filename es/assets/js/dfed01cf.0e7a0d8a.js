And since Serenity BDD has many shortcuts to handle these options, it\'s worth knowing what has changed, what won\'t work any more, and what you need to update.\\n\\nSo here\'s the rundown (with a focus on Chrome, the most widely used driver):\\n\\n## No more downloading drivers\\n\\nIn previous versions of Serenity BDD, you could use the `webdriver.driver.autodownload` property to make Serenity (using WebDriverManager) automatically download the right driver for your platform. \\nThe latest versions of Serenity BDD integrate with Selenium 4.8.0, which has this feature built-in, so you can now safely set the `webdriver.driver.autodownload` property to false in your `serenity.conf` file, or remove it entirely.\\n\\n## Headless mode\\n\\nHeadless mode is going away! Well, not quite - but the convenience method provided in the ChromeOptions class to set the headless mode (`setHeadless()`) is being deprecated, and will be disabled in a future version. For this reason, the Serenity BDD `headless.mode` property is now deprecated - you\'ll need to configure headless execution in the W3C configuration \\n\\n## W3C configuration for Chrome\\n\\nIn the latest versions of Serenity, all the chrome options can be configured using the \\"goog:chromeOptions\\" section inside the `webdriver.capabilities` section of your `serenity.conf` file. (Other W3C capabilites, such as browserName and timeouts, also go in the `webdriver.capabilities` section).\\n\\nLet\'s have a look at a few of the more useful \\"goog:chromeOptions\\" arguments.\\n\\n### Headless mode\\n\\nTo activate headless mode in newer version, you will need to use the ` - headless` argument. According to the Chrome docs, you should use use \' - headless=chrome\' for browsers v94-108 and \' - headless=new\' for browsers v109+. (The Serenity `headless.mode` property uses the latter option, and is maintained for backward compatibility reasons).\\n\\n```json\\nwebdriver {\\n    capabilities {\\n        \\"goog:chromeOptions\\" {\\n            args = [\\"headless=chrome\\"]\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Arguments\\n\\nYou can define the command-line you want to pass into chrome using the `args`,\\nThe args option in the ChromeDriver Java implementation is a list of command-line options to use when starting the Chrome browser. These options can be used to customize the behavior of the browser and to control how the test is run. For example, you can use the `headless=chrome` argument discussed earlier to run the browser in headless mode, or the `disable-gpu` argument to disable GPU acceleration. \\n\\n```json\\nwebdriver {\\n    capabilities {\\n        \\"goog:chromeOptions\\" {\\n            args = [\\"headless=chrome\\",\\"disable-gpu\\"]\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nSome of the options include the following:\\n - disable-extensions: Disables all installed extensions.\\n - disable-popup-blocking: Allows popups to appear.\\n - disable-translate: Disables the translate feature.\\n - disable-plugins: Disables all plugins.\\n - disable-background-networking: Disables background networking, such as background updates.\\n - disable-web-security: Disables the same-origin policy, which can be useful for testing purposes.\\n - disable-notifications: Disables notifications.\\n - disable-infobars: Disables infobars (information bars that appear at the top of a page).\\n - disable-sync: Disables synchronization.\\n - disable-offer-store-unmasked-wallet-cards: Disables the offering of unmasked credit card information when shopping.\\n - start-maximized: Starts the browser maximized.\\n - incognito: Opens the browser in an incognito mode.\\n - disable-gpu: Disables the use of GPU acceleration.\\n - disable-background-timer-throttling: Disables timer throttling in background pages.\\n - disable-renderer-backgrounding: Disables backgrounding of renderer processes.\\n\\n\\n### Excluded Switches\\n\\nThe `excludeSwitches` parameter lets you to exclude certain command-line options from being passed to the Chrome browser when it is launched. These options can control various aspects of the browser behavior, such as starting it in incognito mode, disabling plugins, or turning off the UI. By excluding these switches, you can ensure that the browser behaves in a consistent and expected manner, which can be useful for testing purposes. \\n\\nYou can pass a list of switch names to the `excludeSwitches` parameter, which goes inside the \\"goog:chromeOptions\\" section in your `serenity.conf` file. \\n\\nFor example, you can use \\" - disable-extensions\\" to prevent extensions from being loaded, or \\" - incognito\\" to start the browser in incognito mode. \\n\\nNote that the `useAutomationExtension` option is deprecated and no longer used by Chrome - if you want to do the equivalent of `useAutomationExtension = false`, add \\"enable-automation\\" to the excludedSwitches parameter, e.g.\\n\\n```json\\nwebdriver {\\n    capabilities {\\n        \\"goog:chromeOptions\\" {\\n            excludeSwitches = [\\"enable-automation\\",\\"load-extension\\"],\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere is a more complete example of a `serenity.conf` file using the W3C options:\\n\\n```json\\n  webdriver {\\n    driver = chrome\\n\\n    capabilities {\\n      browserName = \\"chrome\\"\\n      acceptInsecureCerts = true,\\n\\n      \\"goog:chromeOptions\\" {\\n        args = [\\"start-maximized\\", \\"no-sandbox\\", \\"ignore-certificate-errors\\", \\"disable-popup-blocking\\",\\n                \\"disable-default-apps\\", \\"disable-extensions-file-access-check\\", \\"disable-infobars\\", \\"disable-gpu\\",\\"headless=chrome\\"]\\n\\n        prefs {\\n          default_content_settings.popups = 0,\\n          default_content_settings.geolocation = 2,\\n          credentials_enable_service = false,\\n          password_manager_enabled = false\\n        }\\n        excludeSwitches = [\\"enable-automation\\",\\"load-extension\\"],\\n      }\\n\\n      timeouts {\\n        implicit = 15000\\n        pageLoad = 300000\\n      }\\n    }\\n    wait.for.timeout = 20000\\n  }\\n\\n```"},{"id":"serenity-3.4.1-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/es/blog/serenity-3.4.1-release","editUrl":"https://johnfergusonsmart.com/blog/blog/2022-11-07/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-07/index.md","title":"Serenity 3.4.1 Is Out!","description":"Serenity 3.4.1","date":"2022-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"reporting","permalink":"/es/blog/tags/reporting"},{"inline":true,"label":"locatorless-elements","permalink":"/es/blog/tags/locatorless-elements"},{"inline":true,"label":"selenium-4","permalink":"/es/blog/tags/selenium-4"}],"readingTime":2.24,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"John Ferguson Smart","title":"Creator of Serenity BDD","url":"https://github.com/wakaleo","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55986","key":"wakaleo","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Serenity 3.4.1 Is Out!","description":"Serenity 3.4.1","slug":"serenity-3.4.1-release","authors":["wakaleo"],"tags":["reporting","locatorless-elements","selenium-4"],"image":"data-driven-results.png","hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How To Configure Chrome In Serenity BDD","permalink":"/es/blog/2023/02/02/index"},"nextItem":{"title":"What\'s New In Serenity 3.1.0","permalink":"/es/blog/whats-new-in-serenity-3.1.0"}},"content":"Serenity BDD is one of the most popular Java test automation libraries, and for good reason!\\n\\nIf you are writing automated web tests in Java, using Serenity BDD correctly can reduce the amount of code you need to write by well over 50%, slashing the amount of code you need to maintain yourself.

One of the more interesting is it\'s ability to automatically download the correct driver binaries for whatever browser you are using. Serenity currently does this using WebDriverManager, but as this feature is now build into Selenium, the Serenity WebDriverManager integration is now disabled by default and will be removed in a future version.\\n\\n## Improved Reporting For Data-Driven Tests\\n\\nTest results for data-driven tests (parameterized tests in JUnit and Scenario Outlines in Cucumber) are now reported individually, giving a more precise view of the test status:\\n\\n![](data-driven-results.png)\\n\\n## Standardised naming\\n\\nTo avoid confusion in the summary views, the reports now adopt a more conventional definition of scenarios and test cases for data-driven tests. _Scenario_ refers to the scenario outline or overall test, whereas _Test Case_ refers to a specific execution of a scenario with a specific set of test data.\\n\\n![](scenarios-and-test-cases.png)\\n\\n## Want to learn more?\\nThere are several courses on Serenity BDD in the **[Serenity Dojo Training Library](https://expansion.serenity-dojo.com)**, including\\n* **[Write Better Automated Tests Faster With Serenity BDD, Cucumber and The Screenplay Pattern](https://expansion.serenity-dojo.com/courses/serenity-and-the-screenplay-pattern)** - a free deep-dive course into writing scalable, maintainable tests with Serenity BDD and the Screenplay pattern\\n* **[Effective UI Test Automation With Serenity BDD and Selenium](https://expansion.serenity-dojo.com/courses/testing-web-applications-with-serenity-bdd)** - learn the fundamentals of web testing with Serenity BDD in this very detailed course.\\n* **[Next-generation Automated Acceptance Tests With Serenity Screenplay](https://expansion.serenity-dojo.com/courses/writing-more-sustainable-tests-with-the-screenplay-pattern)** - Learn everything you need to know to master scalable test automation with the powerful Screenplay pattern.\\n* **[Testing REST APIs with Serenity BDD and RestAssured](https://expansion.serenity-dojo.com/courses/testing-rest-apis-with-serenity-bdd)** - Learn how to test REST web services in Serenity BDD."},{"id":"whats-new-in-serenity-3.1.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/es/blog/whats-new-in-serenity-3.1.0","editUrl":"https://johnfergusonsmart.com/blog/blog/2021-11-27/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-27/index.md","title":"What\'s New In Serenity 3.1.0","description":"Serenity 3.1.0","date":"2021-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"reporting","permalink":"/es/blog/tags/reporting"},{"inline":true,"label":"locatorless-elements","permalink":"/es/blog/tags/locatorless-elements"},{"inline":true,"label":"selenium-4","permalink":"/es/blog/tags/selenium-4"}],"readingTime":5.35,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"John Ferguson Smart","title":"Creator of Serenity BDD","url":"https://github.com/wakaleo","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55986","key":"wakaleo","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"What\'s New In Serenity 3.1.0","description":"Serenity 3.1.0","slug":"whats-new-in-serenity-3.1.0","authors":["wakaleo"],"tags":["reporting","locatorless-elements","selenium-4"],"image":"serenity-feature-result.png","hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Serenity 3.4.1 Is Out!","permalink":"/es/blog/serenity-3.4.1-release"}},"content":"Serenity BDD is one of the most popular Java test automation libraries, and for good reason!\\n\\nIf you are writing automated web tests in Java, using Serenity BDD correctly can reduce the amount of code you need to write by well over 50%, slashing the amount of code you need to maintain yourself.

And with over a million downloads a month, regular releases and a vibrant open source community, it\'s a solid bet for your test automation framework!\\n\\nIn this article, we look at some of the new features in Serenity BDD version 3.1.0.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Selenium 4 Integration\\nSerenity 3.1.0 introduces support for Selenium 4.0.0 and Appium 8.0.0-BETA. Selenium 4 is the long-awaited update to Selenium, and includes many new features such as relative locators, better Docker integration with Selenium Grid.\\n\\n## Improved Reporting\\nSerenity BDD is known for its powerful reporting and living documentation features, and in Serenity 3.1.0 the reports have been updated and improved, with many new features and an updated look and feel.\\n![](serenity-report-overview.png)\\n\\n### Test Duration Reports\\nA new chart has been added to show test duration more clearly. You can also drill down into any of the duration buckets to see which tests are slow.\\n![](serenity-durations.png)\\n\\n### Accessibility Mode\\nSerenity BDD 3.1.0 introduces the option to use patterns as well as colours in the charts to make them easier to read for colour vision deficient viewers. You can activate this mode by setting the setting the `serenity.report.accessibility` property to true.\\n\\n![](serenity-patterns.png)\\n\\n### Better Test Result Reporting\\nThe test results for individual features has also been improved to include the additional reporting elements:\\n![](serenity-feature-result.png)\\n\\nScenario and example outcomes are also colour-coded to make it easier to see the results at a glance:\\n![](serenity-example-results-color-coded.png)\\n\\n## Improved WebDriverManager integration\\n\\n[WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager) has a lot of new Selenium 4 features, including the ability to setup a docker instance on the fly. Serenity 3.1.0 provides smooth integration with WebDriverManager with the `WebDriverManagerEnhancer` interface. Just create your own implementation of this interface, and place the implementation in a package that you specify in the `serenity.extension.packages` property. Here\'s an example:\\n\\n```\\npublic class SampleWebDriverManagerEnhancer implements WebDriverManagerEnhancer {\\n    @Override\\n    public WebDriverManager apply(WebDriverManager webDriverManager) {\\n        return webDriverManager.browserInDocker().enableVnc().enableRecording();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Locatorless Web Elements\\nLocatorless web elements are a convenient way Serenity Screenplay lets us locate commonly used elements on a page without needing to write complicated CSS or XPath selectors.\\n\\nFor example, consider the following page:\\n![](saucelabs-example.png)\\n\\nWe could locate and click on the Checkout button with the following code:\\n```\\nactor.attemptsTo(\\n    Click.on(Button.called(\\"Checkout\\"))\\n);\\n```\\nElements are located by human-readable names, which can correspond to the visible text in the element, or an attribute such as id, value or data-test. Heuristic rules are used to determine appropriate locator strategies for different elements.\\n\\nIn other cases, we may want to be more precise. For example, we can also identify form elements by their value or their label:\\n```\\nactor.attemptsTo(\\n    Click.on(Checkbox.withLabel(\\"Terms and conditions\\"))\\n);\\n```\\n\\nWe can also locate elements that are nested inside other elements. For example, the following page contains several \\"Add to cart\\" buttons:\\n![](saucelabs-example2.png)\\n\\nHowever, using locatorless elements, we could click on a specific \\"Add to cart\\" button like this:\\n\\n```\\nactor.attemptsTo(\\n    Click.on(Button.called(\\"Add to cart\\")\\n           .inside(PageElement.called(\\"inventory_item\\")\\n\\t\\t                                 .containingText(\\"Sauce Labs Backpack\\"))\\n    )\\n);\\n```\\nLocatorless elements can help make your code both easier to read and quicker to write, and also more robust, since they may try more than one locator strategy to locate the element you are looking for.\\n\\nSupported elements include:\\n  * Button\\n  * Checkbox\\n  * Dropdown\\n  * Image\\n  * InputField\\n  * Link\\n  * RadioButton\\n  * PageElement\\n\\n## Single Browser Mode\\nSometimes it is useful to be able to run a series of tests in the same browser. This can speed up the tests, though it is important not to allow dependencies to occur between the tests.\\n\\nTo maintain a test open for the duration of a feature or scenario outline, just add the `@singlebrowser` tag, as in the following example:\\n\\n```\\nFeature: Login\\n\\n  Rule: Customers needs to provide valid credentials to access the site\\n\\n    Example: Colin logs in with valid credentials\\n      Given Colin is on the login page\\n      When Colin logs in with valid credentials\\n      Then he should be presented the product catalog\\n\\n    @singlebrowser\\n    Scenario Outline: Login on with invalid credentials\\n      Given Colin is on the login page\\n      When Colin attempts to login with the following credentials:\\n        | username   | password   |\\n        | <username> | <password> |\\n      Then he should be presented with the error message <message>\\n      Examples:\\n        | username        | password       | message                                                     |\\n        | standard_user   | wrong_password | Username and password do not match any user in this service |\\n        | unknown_user    | secret_sauce   | Username and password do not match any user in this service |\\n        | unknown_user    | wrong_password | Username and password do not match any user in this service |\\n        | locked_out_user | secret_sauce   | Sorry, this user has been locked out.                       |\\n```\\n\\nIn JUnit you can use the `@SingleBrowser` annotation for the same result, as shown in this JUnit 5 test:\\n```\\n@ExtendWith(SerenityJUnit5Extension.class)\\n@SingleBrowser\\npublic class WhenLoggingOn {\\n\\n    @Managed(options = \\"headless\\")\\n    WebDriver driver;\\n\\n    @CastMember\\n    Actor charles;\\n\\n    @ParameterizedTest(name = \\"{index}: {2}\\")\\n    @CsvSource(value = {\\n            \\"                       ,secret_sauce       , Username is required\\",\\n            \\"standard_user  ,                          , Password is required\\",\\n            \\"                       ,                          , Username is required\\",\\n            \\"standard_user  , wrong_password , Username and password do not match any user in this service\\",\\n            \\"wrong_user     , secret_sauce       , Username and password do not match any user in this service\\",\\n    })\\n    public void withInvalidCredentials(String username, String password, String errorMessage) {\\n        charles.attemptsTo(\\n                Login.withCredentials(username, password),\\n                Ensure.that(LoginForm.ERROR_MESSAGE).text().contains(errorMessage)\\n        );\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Want to learn more?\\nThere are several courses on Serenity BDD in the **[Serenity Dojo Training Library](https://expansion.serenity-dojo.com)**, including\\n* **[Write Better Automated Tests Faster With Serenity BDD, Cucumber and The Screenplay Pattern](https://expansion.serenity-dojo.com/courses/serenity-and-the-screenplay-pattern)** - a free deep-dive course into writing scalable, maintainable tests with Serenity BDD and the Screenplay pattern\\n* **[Effective UI Test Automation With Serenity BDD and Selenium](https://expansion.serenity-dojo.com/courses/testing-web-applications-with-serenity-bdd)** - learn the fundamentals of web testing with Serenity BDD in this very detailed course.\\n* **[Next-generation Automated Acceptance Tests With Serenity Screenplay](https://expansion.serenity-dojo.com/courses/writing-more-sustainable-tests-with-the-screenplay-pattern)** - Learn everything you need to know to master scalable test automation with the powerful Screenplay pattern.\\n* **[Testing REST APIs with Serenity BDD and RestAssured](https://expansion.serenity-dojo.com/courses/testing-rest-apis-with-serenity-bdd)** - Learn how to test REST web services in Serenity BDD."}]}}')}}]);
